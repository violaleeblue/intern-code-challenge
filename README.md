# Veruca Salt

Little Veruca Salt is having a birthday party.

If there are 6 guests at the party, imagine them all sitting in a circle:

      1  2
    6      3
      5  4

Each guest starts with one goodie bag. The party girl, Veruca Salt, is not very nice; she wants to keep ALL the goodie bags and for her guests to go home with nothing, so she makes up a game: starting with seat #1, everyone with a present can take the present from the next person who has a present.

Imagine that in the game the person in seat #1 takes the goodie bag from the person next to her in seat #2. Now Guest 1 has 2 goodie bags and Guest 2 has none. Guest 2 is out of the game and is skipped. Guest 3 takes the bag from Guest 4; Guest 4 is now out and skipped. Guest 5 takes the bag from Guest 6. So at the end of round 1, we have:
Guest 1: 2 bags
Guest 3: 2 bags
Guest 5: 2 bags

In the next round, Guest 1 takes the 2 bags from Guest 3, so now Guest 1 has 4 bags. Guest 3 has none and is out. Guest 5 then takes all 4 bags from Guest 1, and Guest 5 wins: she has all 6 bags!

Which seat would Veruca have to sit in, in order to win all the bags from her guests, if she had a GIANT party and invited 4120682 guests?

Using the programming language of your choice, calculate this result, and output it embedded in the center of a three-column HTML page, like so:

    |    |    |    |
    |red | x  |blue|
    |    |    |    |

The final result should look like the French flag with a number in the middle.
